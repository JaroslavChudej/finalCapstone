# finalCapstone - INVENTORY TRACKER
The INVENTORY TRACKER is a Python program that helps manage stock inventory of a store (originally created for a shoe store as an example and following a brief of an assignment for a capstone project of a bootcamp) . It reads data from a text file and allows users to manipulate the inventory by adding or restocking shoes, searching for shoes, and calculating the total value of each item.
